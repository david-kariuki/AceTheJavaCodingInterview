# Arrays

1. If the size and the values of an array are known in advance, we can use the array literal for adding elements in an array.
   - datatype[] arrayName = {Comma Separated list of values};
2. In Java, arrays are dynamically allocated. Arrays are stored in the memory using a reference pointer, which points to the first element.
3. Pointers - References are used to explicitly store memory locations that hold a value or an object.
4. A Two Dimensional Array is an array of references that holds references to other arrays.
5. In 2D arrays, all values must have the same data type. This means that you can’t store an array of integers next to an array of strings and vice versa. For example, if one array is declared of type int, then its pointer can’t point to
   the string type array. Each element must be of the same data type.
