 * @question Given a list of stock prices, find the maximum profit with a single buy or sell
 *     activity.
 *     <p>We’re given an array of daily stock prices (integers for simplicity). Return the buying
 *     and selling prices for making the maximum profit.
 *     <p>The values in the array represent the cost of stock each day. As we can buy and sell the
 *     stock only once, we need to find the best buy and sell prices that maximize profit (or
 *     minimized loss) over a given span of time.
 *     <p>We need to maximize the profit from a single buy and sell. If we can’t make any profit,
 *     we’ll try to minimize the loss.
